        If you like the caliber of my work and are in need of help, I am able to provide services to assist in
        providing solutions. Since I am currently a full-time student, I am looking for smaller projects such as
        building scripts and program components over larger scale projects. My rates are reasonable, but not
        cheap, because I provide high quality work and document my code exceptionally well with a quick turnaround
        time for what is delivered.
