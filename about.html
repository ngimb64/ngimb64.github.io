        As a cyber engineer, I constantly build software projects, improve my diverse skill set, and enjoy occasional
        challenges such as cyber security capture the flag events. When presented with a problem, I focus on providing
        the solution and the most effective way of its delivery. Aside from my background in networking and cyber
        security, I have years of experience developing projects, with Python being my go-to language for swift
        turnaround. I also have experience with C, assembly, and html/css/javascript used to build this website.

        When I'm not working on computers, I enjoy spending time outside, exercise, steam gaming, and playing guitar;
        which I have been playing for about 17 years.
