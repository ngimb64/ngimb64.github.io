            My name is Nicholas Gimbel, and I am a cyber engineer. I constantly build software projects, improve my
            diverse skill set, and enjoy occasional challenges such as cyber security capture the flag events. When
            presented with problems, I focus on the solution and the most effective way of its delivery.

            When I'm not working on computers, I enjoy playing guitar and have been playing for about 17 years.
